# COMAP
> Turn theory into practice by entering COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right may have started with Pythagoras, but people have been counting as a basic necessity of everyday life for thousands of years. It follows that mathematics was invented to help us understand and manage the world around us.
